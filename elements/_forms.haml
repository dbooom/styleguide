-# Layout types
%h4.styleguide-section--sub-title Form layout types
%p Forms may be styled with several different layout variations. There are two interchangeable layout types with regular and horizontal form elements flow and couple of additional layout customizations.

%hr

%p Each form may be switched from regular (one after another) layout type to horizontal by simply applying single css class to it. However, specific structure and hierarchy must be used to gain complete flexibility.

%p First of all, form contains few logical entities:
%ul
  %li <code>.form-description</code> - optional element which role is to describe purpose of the current form
  %li
    <code>.form-control-group</code> - this is the holder for grouped form elements which are:
    %ul
      %li <code>.form-control-label</code> - label for the control item
      %li
        <code>.form-control</code> - this is another grouping element for:
        %ul
          %li <code>input</code> - may be any form input type
          %li <code>.form-control-help</code> - help text for current element

  %li <code>.form-actions</code> - this is the holder for submits, resets and other form buttons.
