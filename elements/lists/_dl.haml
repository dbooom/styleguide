-# Definition list -----------------------------------------------------------
%p The <code>dl</code> element is for another type of list called a definition list. Instead of list items, the content of a <code>dl</code> consists of <code>dt</code> (Definition Term) and <code>dd</code> (Definition description) pairs. Though it may be called a “definition list”, <code>dl</code> can apply to other scenarios where a parent/child relationship is applicable. For example, it may be used for marking up dialogues, with each <code>dt</code> naming a speaker, and each <code>dd</code> containing his or her words.

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %dl
    %dt This is a term.
    %dd This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.
    %dt Here is another term.
    %dd And it gets a definition too, which is this line.
    %dt Here is term that shares a definition with the term below.
    %dt Here is a defined term.
    %dd <code>dt</code> terms may stand on their own without an accompanying <code>dd</code>, but in that case they <em>share</em> descriptions with the next available <code>dt</code>. You may not have a <code>dd</code> without a parent <code>dt</code>.
-# /Example

-# Code
= featureCode do
  :numcode
    <dl>
      <dt>This is a term.</dt>
      <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
-# /Code


-# Definition list horizontal ------------------------------------------------
%p Alternative, horizontal <code>dl</code> layout is available. To get this type of <code>dl</code> list, <code>.dl-horizontal</code> class should be applied.

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %dl.dl-horizontal
    %dt This is a term.
    %dd This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.
    %dt Here is another term.
    %dd And it gets a definition too, which is this line.
-# /Example

-# Code
= featureCode do
  :numcode
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>This is a term.</dt>
      <dd>This is the definition of that term, which both live in a <code>dl</code>.</dd>
    </dl>
-# /Code
