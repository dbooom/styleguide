-# Unordered list ------------------------------------------------------------
%p The <code>ul</code> element denotes an unordered list (i.e. a list of loose items that donâ€™t require numbering, or a bulleted list). Again, each item requires a surrounding <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tag, to denote individual items. Here is an example list showing the constituent parts of the British Isles:

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %ul
    %li
      United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:
      %ul
        %li England
        %li Scotland
        %li Wales
        %li Northern Ireland
    %li Republic of Ireland
    %li Isle of Man
    %li
      Channel Islands:
      %ul
        %li Bailiwick of Guernsey
        %li Bailiwick of Jersey
-# /Example

-# Code
= featureCode do
  :numcode
    <ul>
      <li>
        United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:
        <ul>
          <li>England</li>
          <li>Scotland</li>
          <li>Wales</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Republic of Ireland</li>
    </ul>

-# Unordered list with block element -----------------------------------------
%p Sometimes we may want each list item to contain block elements, typically a paragraph or two.

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %ul
    %li
      %p The British Isles is an archipelago consisting of the two large islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and many smaller surrounding islands.
    %li
      %p Great Britain is the largest island of the archipelago. Ireland is the second largest island of the archipelago and lies directly to the west of Great Britain.
    %li
      %p The full list of islands in the British Isles includes over 1,000 islands, of which 51 have an area larger than 20 km<sup>2</sup>.
