-# Pre-formatted text --------------------------------------------------------
%p The <code>pre</code> element represents a block of pre-formatted text, in which structure is represented by typographic conventions rather than by elements. Such examples are an e-mail (with paragraphs indicated by blank lines, lists indicated by lines prefixed with a bullet), fragments of computer code (with structure indicated according to the conventions of that language) or displaying <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> art. Hereâ€™s an example showing the printable characters of <abbr>ASCII</abbr>:
