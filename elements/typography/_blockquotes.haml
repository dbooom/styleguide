-# Blockquote regular --------------------------------------------------------
%p The <code>blockquote</code> element represents a section that is being quoted from another source.

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %blockquote{ :cite => 'http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206'}
    %p Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
-# /Example

-# Code
= featureCode do
  :numcode
    <blockquote cite="http://example.com">
      <p>Blockquote content.</p>
    </blockquote>
-# /Code


-# Blockquote in figure ------------------------------------------------------
%p Additionally, you might wish to cite the source, as in the above example. The correct method involves including the <code>cite</code> attribute on the <code>blockquote</code> element, but since no browser makes any use of that information, itâ€™s useful to link to the source also.
%p The following example shows, how it is possible to add description and link to the source of <code>blockquote</code> in semantic way using <code>figure</code> markup:

-# Example
= featureExample do
  %figure.blockquote
    %blockquote{ :cite => 'http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1947/nov/11/parliament-bill#column_206'}
      %p Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
